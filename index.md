# Welcome!

This is my website! It It has been made with **jekyll**, a good ammount of time, and delivered through **github pages**!

## What is this all about?
I have come across personal website in the past and always found them fascinating! As a computer engineer I could not resist the temptation to tinker around and build my own.

At first I decided to have just my curriculum (which you can check it out [here!](/curriculum)) following the same design i had for the paper one. Some months later I decided it was both not enough and lacked some better design. I then put some more time in css and js (since it is a somewhat static website there's not much backend \*sigh\*) and this is what came out of it. It is the same as the old one, but with a landing page (this one lol) and a Blog (plus some layout redesign).


## Me
I, as stated above, am a computer engineer, love to tinker around. Built a couple of apps, a handful of websites and played around with an arduino a bit.

Besides working/studying and having these kinds of entertainment I have much more depth and enjoy spending time in different hobbies. 
For instance you ~~can~~ **must** see the videos I made of my journeys around the globe (at least Europe for now) on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/steps.by.steps/channel/) ❤️
