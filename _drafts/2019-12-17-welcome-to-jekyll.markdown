During the developing of my master thesis work I found I needed to compute a cumulative sum of some fields. Using Kibana for Business Analytics it is possible to compute the cumulative sum, but with a caveat: it is computed on the selected time span. This is an usual and correct behaviour in reporting tools, but what happened if the value itself has to be computed?

As in any BI enviroment the solution is to store the value inside the datawarehouse (or extracted at runtime if using a virtual datawarehouse technique). Inside the ELK stack Logstash is with respect to a more standard BI architecture (i.e. not using ELK) is the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool.

Logstash has several filters, but none would enable me to achieve what I envisioned. Memorize filter developed by alcanzar (https://github.com/alcanzar/logstash-filter-memorize) was the closest one, yet wasn't directly available for Logstash 7.6 due to requirements. A simple adjusment made the plugin work as intended on Logstash 7.x, but was not possible todo was I wanted to do. This is way I developed the [**logstash-filter-cusum**](https://github.com/deletX/logstash-filter-cusum/) filter plugin.

## Documentation

This plugin is used to do a simple cumulative sum. It has 3 simple parameters:
1. **fields** *[array, required]* this contains the name of the fields that will contain the current cumulative sum value
1. **add_values** *[hash]* a dictionary that indicates the value to add for each field. Defaults to 0
1. **initial_values** *[hash]* a dictionary that indicates the value to use if no stored value is found. Defaults to 0

You can use it in this simple way:
```
filter {
  cusum{
    fields => ["apples","bananas"]
    add_values => {
        "apples"  => "%{apples_to_add}"
        "bananas" => "-2"
      }
    initial_values => {
        "bananas" => "%{[default_bananas]}"
      }
  }
}	
```
